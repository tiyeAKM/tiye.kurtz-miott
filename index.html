    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am currently a senior majoring in Cognitive Science with a Machine Learning and Neural Computation Specialization and Data Science minor at UC San Diego. I am focusing on finishing courses for my specialization throughout the summer and strengthening my skills and understanding of Machine Learning techniques. Last year, I studied abroad in Berlin, Germany and took classes for my major at the Technical University of Berlin while also learning German.</p>
    <p>With the completion of my services as a Data Science Intern at UC San Diego, my work in analyzing sustainability data for water, energy, and natural gas usage honed my proficiency in data entry and cleaning, with the help of my skills in the Google Cloud Platform. Our team's initiatives contributed to the university's sustainability efforts, demonstrating my commitment to leveraging data science for impactful environmental and societal solutions.</p>
    <p>My experience extends to mentoring young coders as a Teacher's Assistant at Girls Who Code, where I facilitated the learning of web technologies and oversaw the progress of a group of dedicated students. In anticipation of my graduation from UC San Diego, my goal is to merge my knowledge in cognitive science with my practical expertise in data science, aspiring to eventually lead or manage a team in the realm of machine learning and neural computation.</p>
